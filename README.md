* Subset I —> subset with no duplicate element in list
            use DFS
*  Subset II  —>  subset with duplicate.
            use DFS
            be careful with the duplicate part.

  //Binary Tree and Divide Conquer
* Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

* Hash Function
* Balanced Binary Tree
            two different strategy: 1) create a new class for containing result, with field of maxDepth and isBalanced
                                                2) use only int result to represent maxDepth of subtree when balanced and -1 when the                 
                                                        subtree is not balanced.

* balanced tree sum: 
* balanced tree sum ii: 
            root to any
            root to leaf
            any to any // the most difficult problem for binary divide and conquer
